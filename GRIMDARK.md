Death honors my masters, Death honors my victims
My rage is my weapon, my rage is their fear
My blade is my weapon, my blade is their fear
My body is theirs to use, my body is theirs to destroy
I am an instrument of war, I am an instrument of death
I choose to die, but only after I have served my purpose
